I got so much done it's insane.\n\nProjects:\r\n1) the printer auto-configuration script.\r\n2) changing Stripe from test mode to live mode in production\r\n3) website responsiveness\n\nI finished two within five minutes and pushed to both QA and Production.  actually urgent, actually necessary.  Easy change.\n\nThe printer auto-configure script was honestly fun to write, if very involved.  However, the APIs I needed to call to fetch data, create a printer client, etc... none of them were tested, and they were _all_ broken in at least two ways.  The CTO (api guy in my previous rant) was slow at fixing them, so getting the APIs working took literally four hours.  One of them (test print) still doesn't work.\n\nResponsiveness... this was my first time making a website responsive. Ever.  Also, one of the pages I needed to style was very complicated (nested fixed-aspect-ratio + flexbox); I ended up duplicating the markup and hacking the styling together just to make it work.  The code is horrible.  But!  \"Friday's the day! it's going live and we're pushing traffic to it!\"  So, I invested a lot of time and energy into making it ready and as pretty as I could, and finally got it working.  That page alone took me two hours.\n\nThe site and the printer script (and obv the Stripe change as well) absolutely needed to be done by this morning.  Super important.\n\nwell.\n\n1) Auto-configure script.  Ostensibly we would have an intern come in and configure the printers.  However, we have no printers that need configuring, so she did marketing instead. :\/  Also, the docs Epson sent us only work for the T88V printer (we have exactly one, which we happened to set up and connect to).  They do not work for the T88VI printers, which is what we ordered.  and all we'll ever be ordering. So. :\/ I'll need to rewrite a large chunk of my code to make this work. Joy :\/\n\n2) Stripe Live mode.  Nobody even seemed to notice that we were collecting info in Test mode, or that I fixed it.  so. um. :\/\n\n3) Responsiveness.\r\nWell.  That deadline is actually next Wednesday. The marketing won't even start until then, and I haven't even been given the final changes yet (like come on).  Also! I asked for a QA review last night before I'd push it to production. One person glanced at it.  Nobody else cared.  Nobody else cared enough to look in the morning, either, so it's still on QA.  Super-important deadline indeed. :\/\n\nHonestly?\n\nI feel like Alice (from Dilbert) after she worked frantically on urgent projects that ended up just being cancelled.  (That one where Wally smells that lovely buttery-popcorn scent of unnecessary work.)\n\nI worked 13 hours yesterday.\r\nfor nothing.\n\nfucking. hell.","score":41,"created_time":1508533718,"attached_image":"","num_comments":7,"tags":["undefined","fuck off","we urgently don't need this yet!","unnecessary work","unsung heroine","i'm starting to feel like dark terra."],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":7,"user_id":449087,"user_username":"Root","user_score":51040,"user_avatar":{"b":"d55161","i":"v-35_c-3_b-5_g-f_9-2_1-1_16-19_3-12_8-4_7-4_5-4_12-1_6-36_2-26_22-2_11-2_18-2_19-3_4-4_21-3.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"d55161","i":"v-35_c-1_b-5_g-f_9-2_1-1_16-19_3-12_8-4_7-4_5-4_12-1_6-36_2-26_22-2_11-2_18-2_19-3_4-4_21-3.png"},"user_dpp":1},{"id":506889,"text":"Fuck, Roommate turned off Internet and made me waste 1gb of 4G Data.","score":41,"created_time":1491026613,"attached_image":"","num_comments":7,"tags":["undefined"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":7,"user_id":183111,"user_username":"Pgdevpatryk","user_score":2040,"user_avatar":{"b":"69c9cd","i":"v-35_c-3_b-6_g-m_9-1_1-1_16-3_3-5_8-2_7-2_5-2_12-1_6-10_10-9_2-47_22-1_15-5_11-7_18-4_19-3_4-2.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"69c9cd","i":"v-35_c-1_b-6_g-m_9-1_1-1_16-3_3-5_8-2_7-2_5-2_12-1_6-10_10-9_2-47_22-1_15-5_11-7_18-4_19-3_4-2.png"}},{"id":594968,"text":"I am so fucking sick of getting asked to implement special cases \/ features for 1 fucking customer just because the customer wants to do something differently (read fucking stupidly).\n\nThis piece of shit codebase already has easy on 500 special cases that were put in place to please some asshole who does'nt even use the feature he demanded once he realised what a wanker he was being.\n\nNow I have to put in yet another bunch of conditional statements all over the place to pad another fucking douche bags ego.\n\nFor fuck sake can they not just use the software as it is.

However, despite not mixing cin>> and getline and having tried a number of methods I still cannot get it working.\nSo far I have attempted using a cin.ignore() call to clear any '\\n' char's from the buffer, as well as checking if the file is opening in the first place (it is), and using the >> operator instead throughout my code however I could not get that working either. When I place the get line call inside the condition of the while loop, the while loop doesn't run, however when I make the while loop condition a .eof() call it will run once however when I try to print the text that has been read from the getline call it just prints a blank line.\nif(file.is_open()){\n        while(!file.eof()){\n            getline(file, text, '-');\n            count++;\n            cout<<count<<endl;\n            cout<<text<<endl;\n            if(count%2 == 1){\n                wordBuff = text;\n            }else if(count%2 == 0){\n                if(stoi(text) == wordClass){\n                    wordList.push_back(wordBuff);\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        file.close();\n    }\nWhile I recognise there are a lot of other questions on this out there I cannot seem to get any of their solutions to work and the vast number being related to people mixing the >> operator and getline doesn't help, so any tips or solutions will be of great help","score":8,"created_time":1555861104,"attached_image":"","num_comments":2,"tags":["rant","fuck off and die","hate","stackoverflow","c++","dickheads"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":1,"user_id":65605,"user_username":"hidden","user_score":1208,"user_avatar":{"b":"d55161","i":"v-35_c-3_b-5_g-m_9-1_1-3_16-3_3-1_8-1_7-1_5-1_12-3_6-10_2-17_22-1_4-1.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"d55161","i":"v-35_c-1_b-5_g-m_9-1_1-3_16-3_3-1_8-1_7-1_5-1_12-3_6-10_2-17_22-1_4-1.png"}},{"id":684813,"text":"The thing I hate the most at the moment, is working\/receiving tasks on chat (Skype, telegram). \nContent, corrections and all.

Nobody expects you to be the best early in your career, so don't act like you are.\n\n2) Working independently is a must. It's okay to ask questions, but ask sparingly. Remember, mid and senior level guys need to focus just as much as you do, so before interrupting them, exhaust your resources (Google, Stack Overflow, books, etc..)\n\n3) Working code != good code. You are an author. Write your code so that it can be read. Accept criticism that may seem trivial such as renaming a variable or method. If someone is suggesting it, it's because they didn't know what it did without further investigation.\n\n4) Ask for peer reviews and LISTEN to the critique. Even after 20+ years, I send my code to more junior developers and often get good corrections sent back. (remember the ego thing from tip #1?) Even if they have no critiques for me, sometimes they will see a technique I used and learn from that. Peer reviews are win-win-win.\n\n5) When in doubt, do NOT BS your way out. Refer to someone who knows, or offer to get back to them. Often times, persons other than engineers will take what you said as gospel. If that later turns out to be wrong, a bunch of people will have to get involved to clean up the expectations.\n\n6) Slow down in order to speed up. Always start a task by thinking about the very high level use cases, then slowly work through your logic to achieve that. Rushing to complete, even for senior engineers, usually means less-than-ideal code that somebody will have to maintain.\n\n7) Write documentation, always! Even if your company doesn't take documentation seriously, other engineers will remember how well documented your code is, and they will appreciate you for it\/think of you next time that sweet job opens up.\n\n8) Good code is important, but good impressions are better. I have code that is the most embarrassing crap ever still in production to this day. People don't think of me as \"that shitty developer who wrote that ugly ass code that one time a decade ago,\" They think of me as \"that developer who was fun to work with and busted his ass.\" Because of that, I've never been unemployed for more than a day. It's critical to have a good network and good references.\n\n9) Don't shy away from the unknown. It's easy to hope somebody else picks up that task that you don't understand, but you wont learn it if they do. The daunting, unknown tasks are the most rewarding to complete (and trust me, other devs will notice.)\n\n10) Learning is up to you. I can't tell you the number of engineers I passed on hiring because their answer to what they know about PHP7 was: \"Nothing. I haven't learned it yet because my current company is still using PHP5.\" This is YOUR craft. It's not up to your employer to keep you relevant in the job market, it's up to YOU. You don't always need to be a pro at the latest and greatest, but at least read the changelog. Stay abreast of current technology, security threats, etc...\n\nThese are just a few quick tips from my experience. Others may chime in with theirs, and some may dispute mine.

We ran it and now production is DOWN! Join this bridgeline now and help us fix this!\" \n\nSo, as the author of the code in question, I join the bridge... And what happens next, I will simply never forget. \n\nFirst, a little backstory... Another team within our company needed some vendor client software installed and maintained across the enterprise. Multiple OSes (Linux, AIX, Solaris, HPUX, etc.), so packaging and consistent update methods were a a challenge. I wrote an entire set of utilities to install, update and generally maintain the software; intending all the time that this other team would eventually own the process and code. With this in mind, I wrote extensive documentation, and conducted a formal turnover \/ training season with the other team. \n\nSo, fast forward to when the other team now owns my code, has been trained on how to use it, including (perhaps most importantly) how to send out updates when the vendor released upgrades to the agent software. \n\nNow, this other team had the responsibility of releasing their first update since I gave them the process. Very simple upgrade process, already fully automated. What could have gone so horribly wrong? Did something the vendor supplied break their client? \n\nI asked for the log files from the upgrade process. They sent them, and they looked... wrong. Very, very wrong. \n\nDid you run the code I gave you to do this update? \n\n\"Yes, your code is broken - fix it! Production is down! Rabble, rabble, rabble!\"\n\nSo, I go into our code management tool and review the _actual_ script they ran. Sure enough, it is my code... But something is very wrong. \n\nMore than 2\/3rds of my code... has been commented out. The code is \"there\"... but has been commented out so it is not being executed. WT-actual-F?! \n\nI question this on the bridge line. Silence. I insist someone explain what is going on. Is this a joke? Is this some kind of work version of candid camera? \nFinally someone breaks the silence and explains. \n\nAnd this, my friends, is the part I will never forget.\n\n\"We wanted to look through your code before we ran the update. When we looked at it, there was some stuff we didn't understand, so we commented that stuff out.\"\n\nYou... you didn't... understand... my some of the code... so you... you didn't ask me about it... you didn't try to actually figure out what it did... you... commented it OUT?! \n\n\"Right, we figured it was better to only run the parts we understood...

Do you know what a linked list is?\n\nX: (Tells what it is).\n\nI: Great. Can you tell me where linked lists are used?\n\nX:: Sure. In interview questions.\n\nI: What?\n\nX: The only time linked lists come up is in interview questions.\n\nI:: That\u2019s not true. They have lots of real world applications. Like, like\u2026. (fumbles)\n\nX:: Like to implement memory allocation in operating systems. But you don\u2019t sell operating systems, do you?\n\nI:: Well\u2026 moving on. Do you know what the Big O notation is?\n\nX: Sure. It\u2019s another thing used only in interviews.\n\nI: What?! Not true at all. What if you want to sort a billion records a minute, like Google has to?\n\nX: But you are not Google, are you? You are hiring me to work with 5 year old PHP code, and most of the tasks will be hacking HTML\/CSS. Why don\u2019t you ask me something I will actually be doing?\r\nI: (Getting a bit frustrated)\u00a0 Fine. How would you do FooBar in version X of PHP?\n\nX: I would, er, Google that.\n\nI: And how do you call library ABC in PHP?\n\nX: Google?\n\nI: (shocked) OMG. You mean you don\u2019t remember all the 97 million PHP functions, and have to actually Google stuff? What if the Internet goes down?\n\nX: Does it? We\u2019re in the 1st world, aren\u2019t we?\n\nI: Tut, tut. Kids these days. Anyway,looking at your resume, we need at least 7 years of ReactJS. You don\u2019t have that.\n\nX: That\u2019s great, because React came out last year.\n\nI: Excuses, excuses. Let\u2019s ask some lateral thinking questions. How would you go about finding how many piano tuners there are in San Francisco?\n\nX: 37.\n\nI: What?!\n\nX: 37. I googled before coming here. Also Googled other puzzle questions. You can fit 7,895,345 balls in a Boeing 747. Manholes covers are round because that is the shape that won\u2019t fall in. You ask the guard what the other guard would say. You then take the fox across the bridge first, and eat the chicken. As for how to move Mount Fuji, you tell it a sad story.\n\nI: Ooooooooookkkkkaaaayyyyyyy. Right, tell me a bit about yourself.\n\nX: Everything is there in the resume.\n\nI: I mean other than that. What sort of a person are you? What are your hobbies?\n\nX: Japanese culture.\n\nI: Interesting. What specifically?\n\nX: Hentai.\n\nI: What\u2019s hentai?\n\nX: It\u2019s an televised art form.\n\nI: Ok. Now, can you give me an example of a time when you were really challenged?\n\nX: Well, just the other day, a few pennies from my pocket fell behind the sofa. Took me an hour to take them out. Boy was it challenging.\n\nI: I meant technical challenge.\n\nX: I once spent 10 hours installing Windows 10 on a Mac.\n\nI: Why did you do that?\n\nX: I had nothing better to do.\n\nI: Why did you decide to apply to us?\n\nX: The voices in my head told me.\n\nI: What?\n\nX: You advertised a job, so I applied.\r\nI: And why do you want to change your job?\n\nX: Money, baby!\n\nI: (shocked)\n\nX: I mean, I am looking for more lateral changes in a fast moving cloud connected social media agile web 2.0 company.\n\nI: Great. That\u2019s the answer we were looking for.\u00a0 What do you feel about constant overtime?\n\nX: I don\u2019t know. What do you feel about overtime pay?\n\nI: What is your biggest weakness?\n\nX: Kryptonite. Also, ice cream.\n\nI: What are your salary expectations?\n\nX: A million dollars a year, three months paid vacation on the beach, stock options, the lot. Failing that, whatever you have.\n\nI: Great. Any questions for me?\n\nX: No.\n\nI: No? You are supposed to ask me a question, to impress me with your knowledge. I\u2019ll ask you one. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?\n\nX: Doing your job, minus the stupid questions.\n\nI: Get out.

Automatically picks reasons from an array of strings, randomly. Runs inside a cron-job. The job fires if there are active SSH-sessions on the server after 9pm with his login.\n\nxxx: kumar-asshole.sh - scans the inbox for emails from \"Kumar\" (a DBA at our clients). Looks for keywords like \"help\", \"trouble\", \"sorry\" etc. If keywords are found - the script SSHes into the clients server and rolls back the staging database to the latest backup. Then sends a reply \"no worries mate, be careful next time\".\n\nxxx: hangover.sh - another cron-job that is set to specific dates. Sends automated emails like \"not feeling well\/gonna work from home\" etc. Adds a random \"reason\" from another predefined array of strings. Fires if there are no interactive sessions on the server at 8:45am.\n\nxxx: (and the oscar goes to) fuckingcoffee.sh - this one waits exactly 17 seconds (!), then opens an SSH session to our coffee-machine (we had no frikin idea the coffee machine is on the network, runs linux and has SSHD up and running) and sends some weird gibberish to it.

So the remote team I work with had an opening for a new iOS developer (unrelated to anything to do with me). They interviewed and hired a guy based off his \"amazing\" take home challenge.\n\nThe challenge consists of 4 screens and was for a senior level position. For the challenge the interviewee created a framework (a iOS library) for each screen, included all the business logic for each screen inside, each one needs to be built separately, exposed some API\/functions from each one and then created a main project to stitch it all together.\n\nNow, my opinion is, this is highly unscalable and a ridiculous approach to take as it would add so much unnecessary overhead, for no benefit (I am correct btw).\n\nThe interviewee said he did it like this to \"show off his skills and to stand out\". The remote team loved it and hired him. The challenge said \"show us the code standard you would be happy to release to production\". I would argue that he has only demonstrated 1 extra skill, and in exchange delivered something that is unscalable, going to be a nightmare to automate and require huge on-boarding and a paradigm shift, for no reason. To me thats a fail for a senior to not realise what he's doing. This person will be required to work alone (in part), make architecture decisions, set the foundation for others etc. Having someone who is willing to just do mad shit to show off, is really not the type of person suited to this role.\n\nDebate!","score":24,"created_time":1557333613,"attached_image":"","num_comments":15,"tags":["rant","debate"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":1,"user_id":190725,"user_username":"practiseSafeHex","user_score":16860,"user_avatar":{"b":"2a8b9d","i":"v-35_c-3_b-4_g-m_9-1_1-1_16-6_3-1_8-3_7-3_5-3_12-1_6-2_10-1_2-47_22-1_18-4_19-3_4-3_20-8.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"2a8b9d","i":"v-35_c-1_b-4_g-m_9-1_1-1_16-6_3-1_8-3_7-3_5-3_12-1_6-2_10-1_2-47_22-1_18-4_19-3_4-3_20-8.png"}},{"id":2146785,"text":"Not related to programming.........","score":31,"created_time":1560839262,"attached_image":{"url":"https:\/\/img.devrant.com\/devrant\/rant\/r_2146785_QDSxf.jpg","width":800,"height":702},"num_comments":2,"tags":["joke\/meme"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":3,"user_id":2024629,"user_username":"k33da","user_score":6607,"user_avatar":{"b":"f99a66","i":"v-35_c-3_b-3_g-m_9-2_1-2_16-18_3-3_8-4_7-4_5-4_12-2_6-2_10-9_2-41_22-7_15-3_11-13_18-4_19-3_4-4_20-15_21-3.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"f99a66","i":"v-35_c-1_b-3_g-m_9-2_1-2_16-18_3-3_8-4_7-4_5-4_12-2_6-2_10-9_2-41_22-7_15-3_11-13_18-4_19-3_4-4_20-15_21-3.png"}},{"id":2146595,"text":"I've recently received another invitation to Google's Foobar challenges.\n\nA while ago someone here on devRant (which I believe works at Google, and whose support I deeply appreciate) sent me a couple of links to it too. Unfortunately back then I didn't take the time to learn the programming languages (Python or Java) that Google requires for these challenges. This time I'm putting everything on Python, as it's the easiest language to learn when coming from Bash.\n\nBut at the end of the day.. I am a sysadmin, not a developer. I don't know a single thing about either of these languages. Yet I can't take these challenges as the sysadmin I am. Instead, I have to learn a new language which chances are I'll never need again outside of some HR dickhead's interview with lateral thinking questions and whiteboard programming, probably prohibited from using Google search like every sane programmer and\/or sysadmin would for practical challenges that actually occur in real life.\n\nI don't want to do that. Google is a once in a lifetime opportunity, I get that. Many people would probably even steal that foobar link from me if they could. But I don't think that for me it's the right thing to do. Google has made a serious difference by actually challenging developers with practical scenarios, and that's vastly superior to whatever a HR person at any other company could cobble together for an interview. But there's one thing that they don't seem to realize. A company like Google consists of more than just developers. Not only that, it probably consists - even within their developer circles - of more than just Python and Java developers. If any company would know about languages that are more optimized such as C, it would be Google that has to leverage this performance in order to be able to deliver their services.\n\nI'll be frank here. Foobar has its own issues that I don't like. But if Google were a nice company, I'd go for it all the way nonetheless - after all, they are arguably the single biggest tech company in the world, and the tech industry itself is one of the biggest ones in the world nowadays. It's safe to say that there's likely no opportunity like working at Google. But I don't think it's the right thing. Even if I did know Python or Java... Even if I did. I don't like Google's business decisions.\n\nI've recently flashed my OnePlus 6T with LineageOS. It's now completely Google-free, except for a stock Yalp account (that I'm too afraid to replace with my actual Google account because oh dear, third-party app stores, oh dear that could damage our business and has to be made highly illegal!1!). My contacts on that phone are are all gone. They're all stored on a Google server somewhere (except for some like @linuxxx' that I consciously stored on device storage and thus lost a while back), waiting for me to log back in and sync them back. I've never asked for this. If Google explicitly told me that they'd sync all my contacts to my Google account and offer feasible alternatives, I'd probably given more priority to building a CalDAV and CardDAV server of my own. Because I do have the skills and desire to maintain that myself. I don't want Google to do this for me.\n\nMove fast and break things. I've even got a special Termux script on my home screen, aptly named Unfuck-Google-Play. Every other day I have to use it. Google Search. When I open it on my Nexus 6P, which was Google's foray into hardware and in which they failed quite spectacularly - I've even almost bent and killed it tonight, after cursing at that piece of shit every goddamn day - the Google app opens, I type some text into it.. and then it just jumps back to the beginning of whatever I was typing. A preloader of sorts. The app is a fucking web page parser, or heck probably even just an API parser. How does that in any way justify such shitty preloaders? How does that in any way justify such crappy performance on anything but the most recent flagships? I could go on about this all day... I used to run modern Linux on a 15 year old laptop, smoothly. So don't you Google tell me that a - probably trillion dollar - company can't do that shit right. When there's (commercialized) community projects like DuckDuckGo that do things a million times better than you do - yet they can't compete with you due to your shit being preloaded on every phone and tablet and impossible to remove without rooting - that you Google can't do that and a lot more. You've got fucking Google Assistant for fucks sake! Yet you can't make a decent search app - the goddamn thing that your company started with in the first place!?\n\nI'm sorry. I'd love to work at Google and taste the diversity that this company has to offer. But there's *a lot* wrong with it at the business end too. That is something that - in that state - I don't think I want to contribute to, despite it being pretty much a lottery ticket that I've been fortunate enough to draw twice.\n\nMaybe I should just start my own company.","score":32,"created_time":1560817696,"attached_image":"","num_comments":8,"tags":["rant","business choices","privacy","google","recruitment","foobar"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":1,"user_id":1541502,"user_username":"Condor","user_score":38367,"user_avatar":{"b":"69c9cd","i":"v-35_c-3_b-6_g-m_9-1_1-1_16-3_3-3_8-3_7-3_5-4_12-1_6-7_10-5_2-50_22-9_15-4_11-3_18-4_19-3_4-4_20-14_21-3.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"69c9cd","i":"v-35_c-1_b-6_g-m_9-1_1-1_16-3_3-3_8-3_7-3_5-4_12-1_6-7_10-5_2-50_22-9_15-4_11-3_18-4_19-3_4-4_20-14_21-3.png"},"user_dpp":1},{"id":2146332,"text":"Here\u2019s a poster with a super short description of each one to help you keep track and find some new useful Linux tools.","score":183,"created_time":1560798340,"attached_image":{"url":"https:\/\/img.devrant.com\/devrant\/rant\/r_2146332_TpCtY.jpg","width":761,"height":999},"num_comments":13,"tags":["rant","linux"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":1,"user_id":1491804,"user_username":"Ekushey","user_score":997,"user_avatar":{"b":"a973a2","i":"v-35_c-3_b-2_g-m_9-1_1-10_16-6_3-2_8-1_7-1_5-1_12-10_6-2_10-5_2-12_22-8_15-8_11-2_18-2_19-2_4-1.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"a973a2","i":"v-35_c-1_b-2_g-m_9-1_1-10_16-6_3-2_8-1_7-1_5-1_12-10_6-2_10-5_2-12_22-8_15-8_11-2_18-2_19-2_4-1.png"}},{"id":2144794,"text":"That fruit is not a sticker \ud83d\ude05\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n++ on this, will book a place on my phoenixMc","score":15,"created_time":1560696109,"attached_image":{"url":"https:\/\/img.devrant.com\/devrant\/rant\/r_2144794_xSTuQ.jpg","width":799,"height":364},"num_comments":2,"tags":["joke\/meme","stickers devrant","macbook","devrant","joke","code"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":3,"user_id":2144595,"user_username":"nomoresuperman","user_score":121,"user_avatar":{"b":"69c9cd","i":"v-35_c-3_b-6_g-m_9-1_1-2_16-3_3-2_8-1_7-1_5-1_12-2_6-6_10-1_2-1_22-7_15-8_11-2_4-1.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"69c9cd","i":"v-35_c-1_b-6_g-m_9-1_1-2_16-3_3-2_8-1_7-1_5-1_12-2_6-6_10-1_2-1_22-7_15-8_11-2_4-1.png"}},{"id":2143332,"text":"While reading through some legacy java code one\r\nof my buddies, who works for a large enterprise, found the following gems:\n\nAccountingReportGenerationImplOfIAbstractGenericBusinessProcessReportGenerator\n\nI mean verbosity is can be helpful but come on.\n\nAnd it has the following function\n\npublic AccountingReportGenerationImplOfIAbstractGenericBusinessProcessReportGenerator\r\ncopyDataFromIAbstractGenericBusinessProcessReportGeneratorInstance(IAbstractGenericBusinessProcessReportGeneratorInstance agbprg){\/*...*\/}\n\nAnd of course, because OOP, this class has a factory class aswell:\n\nAccountingReportGenerationImplOfIAbstractGenericBusinessProcessReportGeneratorFactory\n\nOh and this class is contained as a field in the helpfully named MasterAllDepartmentsSemiAutomatedReportGenerationDataContainerControllerBusinessProcessDataActionController.\n\nAnd that one also has a factory class.\n\nI know naming things is hard, but this is not the answer.\r\nIf any of you are writing such code today, STOP IT!\r\nTHIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE, CUT DOWN ON THAT UNNECESSARY AND UNHELPFUL VERBOSITY!\n\n(And if you are wondering, this code was in production for 17+ years [it's older than me...].)","score":18,"created_time":1560591337,"attached_image":"","num_comments":6,"tags":["rant","naming things","verbosity","rip","java","legacy"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":1,"user_id":970145,"user_username":"xzvf","user_score":12058,"user_avatar":{"b":"2a8b9d","i":"v-35_c-3_b-4_g-m_9-1_1-1_16-14_3-13_8-4_7-4_5-4_12-1_17-2_6-15_10-9_2-66_22-1_11-3_18-4_19-3_4-4_20-13_21-3.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"2a8b9d","i":"v-35_c-1_b-4_g-m_9-1_1-1_16-14_3-13_8-4_7-4_5-4_12-1_17-2_6-15_10-9_2-66_22-1_11-3_18-4_19-3_4-4_20-13_21-3.png"}},{"id":2142119,"text":"How to NOT write unit tests:\n\nA colleague of mine has developed a new package of software, many of our new projects are going to use.

The button team compares the request to a reference button they've built before, and gives an ease score, with higher score being easier (inverse of scrum points).\n\nThese three scores are combined to give a priority score. The global buttonbacklog is sorted by priority.\n\nOnce every two weeks (a \"sprint\") the button team convenes, uses the ease scores to assign scrum points. Difficult tasks are broken up into smaller tasks, because there is a scrum point upper limit. They use the average of the last 5 sprints to calculate each developer's \"velocity\". \n\nThe sprint is filled with tasks, from the top of the global button backlog, up to the team's capacity as determined by velocity. Approximate due dates are assigned, Bob is a happy Bob.\n\nWhat if boss Peter runs into the office screaming \"OUR IMPORTANT CLIENT WANTS A FUCKING PINK BUTTON WHICH MAKES HEARTS APPEAR\"? \n\nDevs tell boss to shut the fuck up and talk to Karen. Karen has a carefully curated list of button building tasks sorted by priority, can sedate boss with valium so he calms the fuck down until he can make a case for the impact and potential of his pink button.\n\nKaren might agree that Peter's pink button gets a higher priority than Bob's blue button. \n\nBut devs are nocturnal creatures, easily disturbed when approached by humans, their natural rhythms thrown out of balance. \n\nSo the sprint is \"locked\", and Peter's pink button appears at the top of the global backlog, from where it flows into the next sprint.\n\nOn rare occasions a sprint is broken open, for example when Karen realizes that all of the end users will commit suicide if they don't have a pink heart-spawning button.\n\nIn such an event, Peter must make Bob happy (because Bob is crying that his blue button is delayed). And Peter must make the button team of devs happy.\n\nThis usually leads to a ritual involving chocolate or even hardware gift certificates to restore balance to the dev ecosystem.","score":263,"created_time":1552381036,"attached_image":"","num_comments":25,"tags":["rant","wk147"],"vote_state":0,"edited":false,"rt":1,"rc":1,"user_id":529089,"user_username":"bittersweet","user_score":34968,"user_avatar":{"b":"a973a2","i":"v-35_c-3_b-2_g-m_9-2_1-2_16-9_3-4_8-4_7-4_5-4_12-2_6-15_2-41_22-10_15-4_18-4_19-2_4-4_20-14.jpg"},"user_avatar_lg":{"b":"a973a2","i":"v-35_c-1_b-2_g-m_9-2_1-2_16-9_3-4_8-4_7-4_5-4_12-2_6-15_2-41_22-10_15-4_18-4_19-2_4-4_20-14.png"},"user_dpp":1},{"id":2015486,"text":"Hey guys...\nSo...\nToday was my first day in a Molding Company (CNC operator)...
